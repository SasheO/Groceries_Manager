## Overview
### Description
Enables user to manage shopping list, pantry records and recipes in one app. The app utilizes [Edamam Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api) and [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3).

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for a mobile device because of its portability and possible push notifications (implemented as a stretch feature).
- **Story:** Cooking is difficult and requires a lot of executive planning which may be difficult for some people. This app aims to make the process a little easier by collating all you need in one place.
- **Market:** Anyone can use this app, particularly adults who manage their own chores
- **Habit:** This app should be used often as it manages user needs for daily living (cooking, getting groceries)
- **Scope:** Pretty limited in scope, could possibly expand to more social app for sharing recipes (and not just making personal recipes or getting recipes from an API)

        query.whereEqualTo("user", ParseUser.getCurrentUser());
        // necessary to include non-primitive types
        query.include("user");
        // order posts by creation date (newest first)
        query.addDescendingOrder("createdAt");
        query.findInBackground();   
```
